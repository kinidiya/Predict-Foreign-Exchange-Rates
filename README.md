# Predicting Foreign Exchange Rates
Within this project, the goal is to predict EUR/USD exchange rates for the forseeable furture with the use of LSTMs, DNNs, and NLP. Using time series analysis, the code will understand the seasonality of the exchange rate. After, the program will adjust rate predictions through correlations of text sentiments found in old political articles to significant rate changes in the past. 

## Data Collection
