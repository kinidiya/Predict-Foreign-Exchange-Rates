# Predicting Foreign Exchange Rates
Within this project, my hope is to be able to predict EUR/USD exchange rates for the forseeable furture with the use of LSTMs, DNNs, and NLP. I will begin by simply using time series analysis to understand the seasonality of the exchange rate. After, I will adjust rate predictions through correlations of text sentiments found in old political articles to significant rate changes in the past.
